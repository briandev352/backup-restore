# Backup-Restore

Restore application for Bring2mind's DNN Backup Solution. When you run the app first, it will create a config file called ```restore.config```. 
In this file you'll need to specify:

1. DecryptionKey of the DNN installation
2. HostGuid of the DNN installation
3. BackupFolder where the backup process has stored the various files
4. RestoreFolder where you wish the DNN site to be recreated
